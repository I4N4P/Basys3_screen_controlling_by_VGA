REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 my_draw_rect/pixel_addr_reg_0 has an input control pin my_draw_rect/pixel_addr_reg_0/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: my_draw_rect/ADDRARDADDR[7]) which is driven by a register (my_internal_reset/reset_out_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>
